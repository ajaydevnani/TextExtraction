# IPro 497 – Product Design Document

## Problem statement

1. It's hard for college students to keep track of the status for all the jobs and internships that they apply for, which sometimes means they miss out on opportunities. This program would eliminate this issue by automatically updating the status of each job that the user has applied for.
2. It's hard for college students to keep track of the status for all the jobs and internships that they apply for, which sometimes means they miss out on opportunities. This program would create a template that would assist the user in organizing all their job applications and the status of them in order to better equip the user with tools to facilitate applying to jobs in the future.
 
## Customer

## Top Application Capabilities (name at least 5)
1. Access from phone (college students almost always have their phones on them)
2. Pull status from multiple places (some info comes from company application portal, some updates come in an email, others through a third party site like LinkedIn or Handshake)
3. Simply GUI (if navigating the app is too much of a hassle the it doesn't really make this process any more convenient, which was the goal)
4. Links to the application itself (ease in being able to respond if status of application is updated: respond to an email about an interview time, accept an offer through the company portal, etc.)
5. Prioritize applications by pin feature

## Top Two to Three Scenarios
[see sample scenarios](https://github.com/mschray/IPro497Sample/blob/main/ScenarioExample.md)

### Your Scenario #1
Adam is a busy college student looking to find a job before he graduates. Since he is using "college student job app," which is ours, he is able to get notifications from all websites just on time by checking our app, and it is easy to use which saves much time then he has more time to enhance resume and do the social stuffs.

### Your Scenario #2
George is about to graduate from college. He has applied over 1000 job applications in the past couple of months. He has not heard back from 573 companies, 387 companies have rejected him, 37 companies have offered him an interview and only 3 companies have given him an offer to work. He was able to attain all this information within a couple of minutes without wasting his time and going through each email or logging in to the company's career site to now his application status.
